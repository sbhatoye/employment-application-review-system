## Objective

To create a software product for a University which allows its 
department faculty members to collaborate and review applicants
and select the best candidate for the job opening. 

## Purpose

The main purpose for creating this software product is to help reduce
overhead costs incurred by the University and to assist hiring 
faculty members by reducing their workload during the applicant-searching 
process. 

## My Role

In this project, I was responsible for the front-end development
of the login screen, the review applications page and the applicant
page. 

## Overview

### Product Scope 

The overall scope of the product is to enable the faculty members to:
1. Log-in to the EARS system
2. Manage system users (add new accounts)
3. Add a new faculty search (committee chair, committee members,
 job position, search starting date and ending date, 
 status of application)
4. List and review applications (view profile, 
post comments on applicants, change applicantsâ€™ status, 
perform a faculty review, assign faculty review)
5. Update account settings (email, name, title, password)


### Product Overview 

Below is a diagram that gives an overview of the system design:
